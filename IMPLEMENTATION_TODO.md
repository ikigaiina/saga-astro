## UI Components Completion

Several UI components are partially implemented but need completion:

- Skill tree visualization
- Combat UI with animations
- Crafting interface
- Quest log and tracking
- World map and exploration interface
- Forger tools interface

## Data Integration

The game has extensive data structures for:

- Skills (5 skill types with detailed progression systems)
- Items (9 item templates with effects and loot tables)
- Quests (5 quest templates with chaining system)
- World (5 regions with landmarks and nexus states)
- NPCs (3 creature types with detailed lifespans and health states)

However, this data needs to be fully integrated with the UI components and game systems.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

The project includes test files but they need to be implemented:

- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Manual QA procedures

## Performance Optimization

- Game loop optimization
- State management efficiency
- UI rendering performance
- Memory usage optimization

## Additional Features

Based on the README, these features are planned but not yet implemented:

- Enhanced AI-driven narrative generation
- Expanded multiplayer features
- Mobile optimization
- Additional regions and content
- Advanced graphics and audio effects
- Community content creation tools
