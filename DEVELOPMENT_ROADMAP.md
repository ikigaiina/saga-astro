## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Complex State Management** - The game has many interconnected systems that need to maintain consistency
2. **Performance Optimization** - Browser-based game with potentially heavy computations
3. **Multiplayer Synchronization** - Real-time coordination between players

### Medium Risk Items
1. **UI/UX Implementation** - Pixel-art style with glassmorphism effects requires careful implementation
2. **Data Integration** - Large amount of game data needs to be properly connected to systems
3. **AI-Driven Narrative** - Complex implementation of dynamic storytelling

### Low Risk Items
1. **Basic Game Systems** - Core mechanics are well-defined and straightforward
2. **Save/Load System** - Already implemented with localStorage
3. **Authentication** - Simple system already in place
