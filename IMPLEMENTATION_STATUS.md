# The Soulforge Saga - Implementation Status

This document provides a summary of the current implementation status of The Soulforge Saga project.

## Overall Progress

The project has a solid foundation with most core systems architected, but implementation is incomplete. The game features a comprehensive design with dual-role gameplay (Wanderer/Forger) and extensive narrative elements.

## Completed Systems

- State Management System
- Basic Character System (attributes, skills, progression)
- Combat System (core mechanics)
- Inventory System (item management, equipment)
- Crafting System (recipes, crafting mechanics)
- Basic Quest System (quest tracking)
- World System (regions, landmarks, exploration)
- Basic Forger System (reality manipulation concepts)
- Save/Load System
- Authentication System

## In Progress Systems

- UI Component Development
- Skill Tree Visualization
- Combat UI and Animations
- Crafting UI
- Quest Log and Tracking
- World Map Implementation
- Forger Tools UI

## Pending Implementation

- Advanced UI Components with animations
- Enemy AI Behaviors
- Item Trading Functionality
- Branching Narrative System
- Dynamic World Events
- Reality Manipulation Features
- Multiplayer Functionality
- Mobile Optimization
- Extended Content (regions, items, quests)

## Data Assets

Extensive game data is available but not fully integrated:
- 5 Skills with detailed progression systems
- 9 Item templates with effects and loot tables
- 5 Quest templates with chaining system
- 5 World regions with landmarks and nexus states
- 3 Creature types with detailed lifespans and health states

## Next Implementation Steps

1. Complete all core UI components
2. Fully integrate game data with systems
3. Implement missing gameplay features
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Optimize performance
6. Implement extended features based on priority

## Testing

Test frameworks exist but actual tests need implementation:
- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Manual QA procedures

## Deployment Status

The project can be built and run with basic functionality, but lacks the complete gameplay experience due to missing UI components and unimplemented features.
